hoverfree
=========

Fork of hoverzoom.net -- this Chrome extension will show an image if you hover its thumbnail or a link.

Read why here: https://gist.github.com/ralph-tice/5087704 or see http://www.reddit.com/r/chrome/comments/19nndn/hoverzoom_stealing_all_its_users_browsing_data/ for discussion.


Philosophy:
===========

HoverFree will be free to use and help people preview a linked image.

HoverFree will never inject advertising, referral links, adware, spyware, etc.

HoverFree will never track or record browsing activity.
